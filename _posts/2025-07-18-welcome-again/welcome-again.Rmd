Howdy! It's been a while since I last tried to start up this blog again. I want to practice writing up and sharing some of my research I've been working on for the past 3 (!!!!) years. The last time I wrote here I was still a wee little undergraduate student who had 0 idea about grad school and alas... here we are.

Of course it wouldn't be me if I didn't talk about food..

I wanted to highlight a new spot in Seattle I really like called [Many Bennies](https://www.manybenniesicecream.com/).


```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)

m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-122.3415891644071, lat=47.65057489209585, popup="Many Bennies!")
m  

```
