### Introduction
This post assumes familiarity with latent class models. [Here] is an intro if you aren't. 
When estimating latent class models, starting values are needed to get the estimation algorithm going. When I first learned about latent class models, I came across this R package [poLCA](https://github.com/dlinzer/poLCA)

### Motivation

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%', results = 'markup'} 
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot1.png")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%', results = 'markup'} 
knitr::include_graphics("Rplot.png")
```

First off, let's get one thing out of the way. Neither of these two models
