Hi! My name is Jessica. I'm a senior at Amherst College studying statistics and psychology. I made this blog for fun in hopes of motivating myself to be a more active programmer and data scientist! I love R and #TidyTuesday. Besides statistics I enjoy finding new places to eat in the D.C/Maryland/Virginia area. 

Here's a list (mainly for myself) of posts I want to make in the next few months:

- Ratings of all the restaurants/cafes I've tried (ideally on a leaflet plot...)
- Food reviews...
- Tidy Tuesday challenges
- Side projects..

I'm also writing a statistics thesis this upcoming fall, so hopefully I'll post updates as that progresses!

### Why croutons?

They're versatile: as a topping for salad, a tasty snack, or an entire meal. My favorite croutons are the ones that come with the caesar salad at Costco.
