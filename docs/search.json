I’m an almost 25 year old\nChinese American living in Seattle but originally from Virginia.\nCurrently, I’m a 4th year PhD student at the University of Washington\nDepartment of Psychology. I’ve been enjoying it so far and I’m looking\nforward to ramping up my research in the next few years. Aside from that\nI’m also an intern/research analyst at UCSF School Health and Evaluation\nResearch. I feel incredibly lucky to apply some of the knowledge from my\ngraduate training to work on projects that directly make an impact on\nyouth mental health in California!\nOn this blog you’ll find some writing about my research. Writing\ndefinitely helps me parse through challenging ideas (and my notes app on\nmy computer is already at 10GB LOL). I’m interested in comparing how\nestimation algorithms produce different parameter estimates in hard to\nestimate latent class models. Also, I’m currently exploring how\ndifferent types of parameter restrictions in latent class models impacts\nestimation. If you read anything interesting and you’d like to chat,\nplease DM me on Twitter @croutontheory. I\ndon’t want to put my email because I’m afraid of SPAM BOTS.\nWhen I’m not doing research, you can find me at whatever new\nrestaurant or cafe that legit just opened 30 seconds ago in Seattle. I’m\ntrying to collate all of my seattle food spots on this page so stay\ntuned. I spend so much money eating out I might as well document it.\n[Disclaimer! The things I write on this blog do not reflect the\nopinions/views of the institutions that I work at, or my advisor! All\nthoughts (and mistakes) are my own..]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
