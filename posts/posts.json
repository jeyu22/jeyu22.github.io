I want to practice writing up and sharing some of my research I’ve been working on for the past 3 (!!!!) years. The last time I wrote here I was still a wee little undergraduate student who had 0 idea about grad school and alas… here we are.\nblah\nblah\nOf course it wouldn’t be me if I didn’t talk about food..\nI wanted to highlight a new spot in Seattle I really like called Many Bennies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I made this blog for fun in hopes of motivating myself to be a more active programmer and data scientist! I love R and #TidyTuesday. Besides statistics I enjoy finding new places to eat in the D.C/Maryland/Virginia area.\nHere’s a list (mainly for myself) of posts I want to make in the next few months:\nRatings of all the restaurants/cafes I’ve tried (ideally on a leaflet plot…)\nFood reviews…\nTidy Tuesday challenges\nSide projects..\nI’m also writing a statistics thesis this upcoming fall, so hopefully I’ll post updates as that progresses!\nWhy croutons?\nThey’re versatile: as a topping for salad, a tasty snack, or an entire meal. My favorite croutons are the ones that come with the caesar salad at Costco.\n\n\n\n",
